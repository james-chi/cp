# cp
copy and paste text over web - very simple

# Introduction
To enhance security, working environment is seperated into two or three, i.e., 
- the Internet-only PC for web surfing,
- development PC for limited internet access, and
- production or operation PC for the internal system management.

To protect data loss, communication among these PCs are restricted. It means that 
I can't use any method which provides file transfer mechanism. The only communication
acceptable is short text messages. So 'cp' is created to exchange short text!

# Requirement
A web server which support PHP script.

# Package
One PHP script file.

# Installation
Donwload the php script file. Modify working directory which is for storing short message and access log.

# Status
Currently, only register and retrieval is supported.

# Language
Mixed - English and Korean

# LOC
- 215 lines

# License
MIT

# Author
Never been a developer.
Writes codes about 200 lines in a year, average. :-)
